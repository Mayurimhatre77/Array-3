#I solved the problem of finding the total amount of rainwater trapped between the bars in a histogram by using a two-pointer approach. The algorithm initializes two pointers, l and r, at the beginning and end of the height array, respectively. It also maintains two variables, ml and mr, to keep track of the maximum heights encountered from the left and right sides. As the pointers move towards each other, the algorithm compares the heights at the pointers to determine which side to process. If the left height is less than or equal to the right height, it updates ml and calculates trapped water at the left pointer. Otherwise, it updates mr and calculates trapped water at the right pointer. The process continues until the pointers meet, ensuring all trapped water is accounted for. The time complexity of this solution is O(n) because each element is processed once, and the space complexity is O(1) since it uses a constant amount of extra space.

class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        l=ml=mr=0
        ans=0
        r=len(height)-1
        while(l<r):
            if height[l]<=height[r]:
                if height[l]>ml:
                    ml=height[l]
                else:
                    ans+=ml-height[l]
                l+=1
            else:
                if height[r]>mr:
                    mr=height[r]
                else:
                    ans+=mr-height[r]
                r-=1
        return ans
